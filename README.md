# heart-disease-project

In this project we will use logistic regression , SVM and KNN models using scikit-learn to predict whether or not a patient has heart disease

We will go through 6 tasks to implement our project:

Task 1: Importing libraries and Exploring the Dataset.

Task 2: Checking missing values.

Task 3: Creating visual methods to analyze the data.

Task 4: make logistic regression model

Task 5: make Support vector machine classification model

Task 6: make KNN model
